## APT is now part of DELFI
This repository contains a 'frozen' version of APT as used for the 2019 ICML submission. It will not be updated with new features, bugfixes, or documentation improvements.

Updates to the code and documentation will continue at the publicly available [delfi](https://github.com/mackelab/delfi) package. Jupyter notebooks are provided there for demonstration purposes, including those reproducing the experiments in the paper.

## Installation instructions
